# Employee Management System

A simple **Employee Management System** built to perform **basic CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee records.  
This project uses **file-based storage**, meaning all employee data is saved and retrieved from a local file instead of a database.

## Features

-  **Add Employee:** Add a new employee record with details such as name, ID, department, and salary.  
-  **View Employees:** Display a list of all employees with their information.  
-  **Update Employee:** Modify existing employee details.  
-  **Delete Employee:** Remove an employee record from the file.  
-  **File-Based Storage:** All data is stored locally in a text file.

##  How It Works

1. The program reads all employee data from a file.  
2. Each CRUD operation updates the file directly.  
3. The program ensures that updates are persistent between runs.
